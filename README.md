# React Counter PWA

A simple counter application, installable to your device.

## Why Did I Build This?

I simply wanted to learn what a PWA is and how to build one at a very basic level.
It also stands as a good template to build future projects from.

## Tech Used

For this project, I chose to use ***React.js*** as the front-end library, coupled with ***Snowpack*** for bundling and minifying code.

### Why [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)?

Snowpack is a much lighter-weight bundler than tools such as Webpack. It's also super fast, which is the main reason I chose
Snowpack over others. In addition to this, their [plugin api](https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/plugins) allows me to extend the functionality
of the bundler to fit the project I'm working on.

Snowpack *is* still fairly new, so it is limited. However, it's still an extremely useful tool for development.
